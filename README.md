## Emails Script

1. Create a `.txt` file with one email address per line, e.g. `emails_sample.txt`
1. Supply the filename, e.g. `emails_sample.txt` as the first argument to the program (see below)
1. Emails are selected at random, up to 5, or use `head` to grab fewer. Emails are "masked" for display.

```sh
ruby emails.rb emails_sample.txt | head -n 3
```
